# tennis-booking-app
A flutter app for tennis &amp; pickleball clubs to streamline court bookings. Members can view real-time availability, reserve/cancel courts, and manage invites. Solves “show up &amp; wait” issues, enforces fair 1–2 hr play, and reduces conflicts. MVP: membership verification, 7-day booking view, make/cancel bookings.

### Problem
The introduction of a single pickleball court has highlighted the issues of the club's "show up and wait" system. Currently, members must physically be at the club to see if a court is available, leading to wasted time and uncertainty. This first-come, first-served approach, combined with the confusion over which court is for which sport, has created a chaotic environment. Players often arrive only to find a long wait. The lack of a transparent system makes it nearly impossible to fairly enforce time limits and ensure all members get equal access to the limited court resources.
